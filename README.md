ASA to Palo Conversion Tool Using A Python Program Called "asa_to_palo_converter.py"

"Version 3 Demo"

ASA to Palo Alto Conversion Script ‚Äì Feature Summary

‚úÖ ASA Rule Parsing

Converts ASA-style access-list rules to Palo Alto format.

üì¶ Object & Object-Group Support

Parses ASA object network and object-group network definitions.

Converts them to Palo Alto set address and set address-group commands.

üõ° Rule Generation in CLI Format

Outputs converted rules as set rulebase security CLI commands.

Includes source, destination, service, and action fields.

üìÅ Panorama XML Export

Optional --xml flag to generate Panorama-compatible XML.

Includes correct Panorama hierarchy with <device-group> and <pre-rulebase> elements.

üè∑ Rule Tagging & Descriptions

Tags and comments are added by default (can be disabled via --no-tags).

Custom tag name support using --tag-name.

üñß Device Group Support

Device group name is customizable with --dg or --device-group.

üîÅ Consistent Object References

Re-uses object names consistently across rules and groups.

Functional Preview of the Script: 

The original ASA config is placed in a .txt file 
(**The ACL name will have to be changed to apply the "from" and "to" name-if directionally
this is the only change that needs to be made in the ASA text file**)

asa_rules.txt (filename can be any name)

object-group network WEB_SERVERS
 network-object host 192.168.3.1
 network-object host 192.168.3.2

access-list INSIDE to OUTSIDE extended permit tcp any object-group WEB_SERVERS eq 80
access-list OUTSIDE to INSIDE extended permit tcp any 200.16.0.21 255.255.255.0 eq 443
access-list INSIDE to OUTSIDE extended permit ip any any

The Python program can show help options using --help

usage: asa_to_palo_converter.py [-h] [--xml] [--dg DEVICE_GROUP] [--no-tags] [--tag-name TAG_NAME] input_file output_file

Convert ASA rules to Palo Alto format.

positional arguments:
  input_file            ASA config input file
  output_file           Output file

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --xml                 Export as XML for Panorama
  --dg DEVICE_GROUP, --device-group DEVICE_GROUP
                        Panorama device group name
  --no-tags             Disable adding tags and descriptions to output rules
  --tag-name TAG_NAME   Custom tag name to apply to rules
  
We can get the converted rule set in Palo "SET" or "XML" commands

use --xml for XML file or Do not add the XML flag for SET CLI commands

Example of CLI SET command version: 
(by default this will include tags and comments, if you want to change it use --no-tags)

$ python3 asa_to_palo_converter.py asa_rules.txt palo_output.txt

palo_output.txt (filename can be any name)

set rulebase security rules INSIDE_TO_OUTSIDE_3 description "Converted from ASA rule: INSIDE_TO_OUTSIDE_3"
set rulebase security rules INSIDE_TO_OUTSIDE_3 tag from-asa

Example of XML version: 
(This will create a Panorama friendly version that can use a device-group name by adding the --dg flag)

$ python3 asa_to_palo_converter.py asa_rules.txt palo_output.xml --xml --dg "Branch1"
